# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# category = ("Law Maker", "Policy Maker")
#
#
# #Fake users
# 5.times do |i|

#   Faker::Internet.email
#   = category.sample(1)
